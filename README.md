# HW22---Team03-v2

This a Robot Trader Algorithm written in Visual Basic for Application. 
The application has the following heuristic:
1) gets stock prices from a database;
2) evaluates the best strategy given current prices and portfolio positions;
3) recommends a buy, sell or hold strategy for each position in the portfolio.

It's a project for the Hedge Tournament, a competition in which students of the IT in Finance class of Prof. Stefano Grazioli at UVa created trading robots that should reduce the beta of a portfolio growing at a constant rate.
